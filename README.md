# Remote Controller of the Drone

This project demonstrates the development of a remote controller for a drone using an ESP32 microcontroller. The remote controller features two joysticks for controlling the movement of the drone. The communication between the remote controller and the drone is established using QuickEspNow, which enables a peer-to-peer (P2P) connection.

## Requirements

- 2 Joysticks
- ESP32 microcontroller
- PlatformIO for development
